# Chroma
Manage photo albums on S3 buckets. Successor to Pxl and Rstr.

## Documentation
To view Chroma's documentation, you should install [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html).
Refer to their docs on how to get it installed.

After installing mdbook:
```
cd docs/
mdbook serve -p 3001
```
>Note: We use port 3001 as to not conflict with Koala, which runs on port 3000.
