# Introduction
Chroma is a picture gallery. Its the successor to Rsr (pronounced 'Raster'), which in itself is a successor to Pxl (pronounced 'pixel').

Chroma uses a MySQL database for metadata storage, an S3 bucket for storing the actual pictures and Koala for authorization.

Chroma's goal is to improve on Pxl, who's major problem was adding pictures and albums.
Refer to Pxl's documentation on how it used to be done. Chroma allows an admin user to upload
pictures directly via its UI.
